#Basics of Python

Python is a readable and versatile programming language. Python has a lot of nice qualities, including:

+ Active user base  
+ Helpful error messages  
+ Nice trade-off between developer and computer time  
+ Many libraries for specialized analyses  
	
## Running Python

Hopefully, all of you completed the installs per the e-mail.

During most of today, we will be working at the interpreter. This is accessed by typing 

```UNIX
$ python
```

at the prompt.

Python commands can also be saved to text files and executed in the terminal, like so:

```UNIX
$ python my_script.py
```

Note that the '.py' extension isn't necessary, but it can be useful to label for easy indexing. 

## Commenting

Through out the day, as you make notes, you might want to save your work as a script. 

And you might be worried you won't recall what it does when you get home on Sunday. In Python, '#' denotes a comment. Using comments in your scripts allows you to remember and explain what blocks of code are using. Use them! Love them!

##Quitting

When working at the interpreter,

```python
exit()
```

will cause Python to quit. Ctrl-D on a Mac does the same. If you're exiting a script, Ctrl-C will end the execute of the script.
